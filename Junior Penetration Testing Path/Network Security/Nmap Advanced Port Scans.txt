1. Null Scan
-all six flag bits are set to zero
- '-sN'
- will not trigger any response when it reaches an open por
-lack of reply: open or firewall is blocking packet
-RST response packet: port is closed
-requires root previleges
eg: sudo nmap -sN [target IP]

2. Fin Scan
-sends TCP packet with the FIN flag set
-'-sF'
-doesn't know if port is open
-RST response: port is closed
-root previleges
eg: sudo nmap -sF [target IP]

3. Xmas Scan
-FIN, PSH and URG flags simultaneously
-'-sX'
-eg: sudo nmap -sX [target IP]
-efficient when scanning a target behind a stateless(non-stateful) firewall.

4. TCP Maimon Scan
-FIN, ACK bits are set, shoudl send an RST as response
-'-sM'
-most systems respond with RST regardless of TCP port is open or not
eg: sudo nmap -sM [target IP]

5. TCP ACK Scan
-ACK flag set
-'-sA'
-responds with RST regardless of the state of the port
-behaviour happens bc TCP packet with ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet
-shows which ports are not blocked by firewall
eg: sudo nmap -sA [target IP]

6. Window Scan
-Similar to ACK scan but it examines the TCP window field of the RST packets returned
-'-sW'
-reveal open port
eg: sudo nmap -sW [target IP]

7. Custom Scan
-set custom flags
-'--scanflags'
eg: sudo nmap --scanflags FLAGS [target IP]
ALL FLAGS: URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN

Spoofing and Decoys
-scan target systems using soofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address
eg: sudo nmap -S [spoofed IP] [target IP]
-reponse sent to the spoofed IP
-important for attacker to monitor the network traffic to analyze replies
1. attacker sends a packet with spoofed source IP address to the target machine
2. target machine replies to the spoofed IP address destination
3. attacker captures reply to analyze open ports
-specify network interfacing using -e
-explicitly disable ping scan -Pn
eg: nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP TARGET_IP
-if on the same subnet, abel to spoof MAC address (same Ethernet or Wifi network)
Decoy: make the scan appear to be coming from many IP addresses
-'-D'
eg: nmap -D DECOY1,ME,DECOY2 [target IP] 

Fragmented Packets
1.Firewall - software or hardware that permits packets to pass through or block them
-traditional firewall - inspects at least, IP header and transport layer header
-sophisticated firewall - examine data carried by transport layer
2.IDS - intrusion detection system - inspects for select behavioral patterns or specific content signatures
-raises alert when a malicious rule is met
-inspects IP header and transport layer header, inspect data contents in transport layer for malicious patterns
-smaller packets have advantage to prevent firewall/IDS
3.Fragmented Packtes
-Nmap provides option '-f' to fragment packets
-IP data divided into 8 bytes or less
- '-ff' divided into 16 byte 
-change the default value '--mtu'
1 byte = 8 bits
-increase size of packets to make them look innocuous --data-length NUM (NUM - number of bytes to append to packets)

Idle/Zombie Scan
-requires an idle system connected to the network that can communicate with
-nmap makes each probe appear it's comming from idle host
-check idle host to see if it received any response to the spoofed probe
-check IP identification value in the IP header
eg: nmap -sI [ZOMBIE_IP] [MACHINE_IP]
1. trigger the idle host to respond so it can record the current IP ID on the idle host
2. send SYN packets to a TCP port on the target (packets should be spoofed to appear its coming from idle host IP)
3. Trigger idle machine again to respond to compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier
