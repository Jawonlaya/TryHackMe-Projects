Passive Reconnaissance
-whois, nslookup, dig
-Publicly available records so they don't alert the target

-DNSDumpster, Shodan.io
-collect information about the target without directly connecting to the target

Reconnaissance(recon): a preliminary survey to gather information about a target

Passive vs. Active
1. Passive: rely on publicly available knowledge without directly engaging with the target
-Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server
-Checking job ads related to the target website
-Reading new articles about the target company

2. Active: requires direct engagement with the target (Invasive)
-connecting to one of the company servers (HTTP, FTP and SMTP)
-calling the company in an attempt to get information (Social Engineering)
-Entering company premises pretending to be someone else

Passive Recon
1. WHOIS - request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. 
- listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests
- domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS record
-Replies with various information
	-Registrar: which registrar is the domain name registered
	-contact info: name, org, address, phone
	-creation, update and expiration dates
	-name server: which server to ask to resolve the domain name

eg: whois tryhackme.com

2. nslookup and dig
nslookup - Name Server Look Up - find the IP address of a domain name

eg: nslookup tryhackme.com

nslookup [options] [DOMAIN_NAME] [Server]
options:
A: IPv4 addresses
AAAA: IPv6 addresses
CNAME: cononical name
MX: mail servers
SOA: Start of Authority
TXT: TXT Records

DOMAIN_NAME: the domain name to be looked up

Server: Server in DNS server to query
-cloudflare: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
-google: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
-Quad9: 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112

eg: check email servers
nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com

dig: Domain Information Groper
dig [@SERVER] [DOMAIN_NAME] TYPE
eg: dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX 

nslookup -type=TXT thmlabs.com

3. DNSDumpster https://dnsdumpster.com
-find subdomains that are not explicitly advertised
-DNSDumpster: gives detailed ansers to DNS queries revealing subdomains that would take time-consuming search to find
-DNSDumpster - also provides any collected information about listening servers
-even attempts to geolocate them
-displays collected information graphically

4. Shodan.io
-learn about connected and exposed devices
-connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected "things"
-result
	-IP address
	-hosting company
	-geographic location
	-server type and version
