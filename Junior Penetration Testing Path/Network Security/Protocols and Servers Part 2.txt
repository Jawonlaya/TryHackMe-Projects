Attack Vectors of Telnet, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP
CIA - DEFENSE
C-Confidentiality: keeping contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties
I-Integrity: assure data sent is accurate, consistent and complete when reaching its destination
A-Availablitity: accessible when needed
DAD - OFFENSE
D-Disclosure: Leak data to unintended parties
A-Alteration: inaccurate, inconsistent, incomplete upon arrival at destination
D-Destruction: unaccessible when needed

Task 2: . Sniffing Attack
-a network packet capture tool
-cleartext can be captured by third party
-Programs available to capture network packets
a. Tcpdump: cli
b. Wireshark: gui
c. Tshark: cli alternative to wireshark

Question 1: What do you need to add to the command sudo tcpdump to capture only Telnet traffic?
Ans: port 23

Question 2: What is the simplest display filter you can use with Wireshark to show only IMAP traffic?
Ans: imap


eg: sudo tcpdump port 23 -A - telnet traffic capture

Task 3. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack
-attacker is in the middle of connection between victim and legitimate destiniation
-HTTP susceptible to MITM attack 
-tools used
a. Ettercap
b. Bettercap
-can also affect other cleartext protocols FTP, SMTP, POP3
-mitigation requires cryptography

Question 1: How many different interfaces does Ettercap offer?
Ans: 3

Question 2: In how many ways can you invoke Bettercap?
Ans: 3

Task 4. Transport Layer Security (TLS)
-SSL - secure sockets layer - online shopping and sending payment information
-TLS - 1999 - more secure
-introduced in the presentation layer of ISO/OSI model
-data will be in an encrypted format instead of original form
-portocols and default ports and secure protocols:

Protocol	Default Port	Secured Protocol	Default Port with TLS
HTTP		80		HTTPS			443
FTP		21		FTPS			990
SMTP		25		SMTPS			465
POP3		110		POP3S			995
IMAP		143		IMAPS			993

-HTTPS requires additional step to encrypt the traffic
1. establish TCP connection
2. establish SSL/TLS connection
3. send HTTP requests to the webserver

SSL Handshake (RFC 6101)
-proper handshake
1. client sends ClientHello to server
2. server responds with ServerHello with certificate if authenticated (id self signed by third party), might send additional information necessary to generate master key.ServerHelloDone
3. client responds with ClientKeyExchange - required to generate masterkey, switches to use encryption and informs the server of the ChangeCipherSpec message
4. Server switches to use encryption and returns ChangeCipherSpec finished 

-web browser will check certificate automatically
DNS -> secure -> DoT port 853

Question: DNS can also be secured using TLS. What is the three-letter acronym of the DNS protocol that uses TLS?
Ans: DoT

Task 5. SSH
-secure shell - created to provide a secure way for remote system admin
-default port 22
-using cryptography
1. confirm identity of the remote server
2. Exchanged messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted by intended recipient
3. Both sides can detect any modification in messages
-SSH listens on port 22 by default
-authenticate using username and password
-private and public key
eg: ssh [username]@[IP address]

-can transfer files using SCP (secure copy protocol)
eg: scp [username]@[IP]:/directory/file.xyz ~
~: copy to the root of the home directory of the currently logged-in user
also the same: scp [file] [username]@[IP]:/directory/

-ssh can be secured using FTPS protocol using port 990

Task 6. Passwork Attack
-Authentication
1. Password and PIN code - KNOW
2. SIM Card, RFID card, USB dongle - HAVE
3. Fingerprint and Iris - ARE

password attackes
1. Guessing: knowledge of target, pet name and date of birth year
2. Dictionary: attempts to guess from dictionary or wordlist
3. Brute Force: exhaustive and time consuming search for all possible characters

THC Hydra: supports many protocols: FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SSH
eg: hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service
- '-l username': -l precede username
- '-p wordlist.txt': -p precede wordlist
- server: host IP
- service: indicates service to be launched
eg: hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.127.204 ftp
-additional arguments
- '-s PORT': specify a non-default port for the service in question
- '-V' or '-vV': verbose or very verbose
- '-t n': n is th enumber of parallel connections to the target
- '-d': debugging
ctrl+c to end process when pw is found

Mitigation
-enforce minimum complexity
-account lockout after number of failed attempts
-throttling authentication attempts
-use CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart)
-reuire public certificate for authentication
-two factor authentication
