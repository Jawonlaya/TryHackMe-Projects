1. Telnet: application layer protocol used to connect to a virtual terminal of another computer
-access console to run programs, start batch processes and perform system admin tasks remotely
-login using username and password
-not encrypted
-uses telnet protocol to listen for incoming connections on port 23
eg: telnet [IP]
-not reliable for access to remote system bc all data is sent in clear text

2. HTTP: protocol used to transfer web pages. 
-connects to the webserver and uses HTTP to request HTML pages and images, submit forms, upload files etc
-sends and receives data as cleartext (not encrypted)
-need HTTP server(webserver) and an HTTP client (web browser) to use HTTP protocol
-Three Popular HTTP servers (Apache, Internet Information Services(IIS), Nginx)
-Web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)

3. FTP: File Transfer Protocol
-created to make transfer of files between different computers efficient
-sends and receives data as cleartext
-default port 21
1. connect to an FTP server using Telnet client
2. provide user and pass
usefull commands:
- 'STAT' - provide some added information
- 'SYST' - shows the system type of the target
- 'PASV' - switches mode to passive
- 'TYPE A' - switches file transfer to ASCII
- 'TYPE I' - switches file transfer mode to binary
Active mode - data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server's port 20
Passive mode - data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client's port above port 1023
After logged in:
'ftp>' - execute various commands
'ls' - list files
'get [FILE NAME]' - client and server extablish another channel for file transfer

4. SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
-Email system can be used to allow local users to exchange emails with each other without access to the internet
-multiple components
1. Mail Submmision Agent (MSA) - has email to be sent, connects to MUA to send message, checks for errors before passing to MTA
2. Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) - send the emamil message to MTA of the recipient 
3. Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) - passed to MDA to deliver to email client
4. Mail User Agent (MUA) - agent send the mail
Two protocols
1. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
2. Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
SMTP - communicate using an MTA server
-cleartext
-default port 25 by default
steps: 
1. telnet [IP] 25
2. helo [hostname]
3. mail from: 
4. rcpt to:
5. data 
6. -ENTER '.' Enter to send

5. Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
-used to download email messages from a mail delivery agent (MDA)
-default port 110
-steps:
1. telnet [IP] 110
2. USER [username]
3. PASS [password]
4. 'STAT'
--reply +OK nn mm--
nn: number of email messages in the inbox
mm: size of the inbox in octates (byte)
5. 'LIST'
-list of messages on server-
6. 'RETR [number]' 
--retrive message from list--

6. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
-more synchronized than POP3
-keep email syncronized across multiple devices and mail clients
-default port: 143
-IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply, c1, c2, etc
-List mail folders: 'LIST "" "*"'
-steps: 
1. telnet [IP] 143
2. c1 LOGIN [username] [password]
3. c2 LIST "" "*"
